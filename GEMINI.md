# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website for a second-year Computer Science student. The goal is to create a clean, minimalistic, and professional website with a modern and approachable aesthetic. The website will be a single-page experience with smooth scrolling navigation.

*   **Framework:** Next.js (React)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Animations:** Framer Motion

The website will feature the following sections:
*   **Hero Section:** A concise headline and links to GitHub and LinkedIn.
*   **About Section:** A short paragraph about the student's interests and skills.
*   **Projects Section:** A curated list of 2-3 projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos and source code.
*   **Contact Section:** A professional email address.

## Building and Running

**TODO:** The following commands are placeholders and need to be verified once the project is initialized.

*   **Installation:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
*   **Running in Development Mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
*   **Building for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
*   **Running in Production Mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Styling:** Use utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. Avoid writing custom CSS files.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The website is structured into reusable React components for each section (`Navbar`, `Hero`, `About`, `Projects`, `Contact`, `Footer`).
*   **Animations:** Use Framer Motion for smooth, subtle animations on scroll and hover.
*   **Code Style:** Follow standard React and JavaScript best practices. The code should be clean, readable, and well-documented.
